# Silk Road Challenge - Telegram Mini App

## Overview
Silk Road Trader Express – A Web3 Trade Adventure

Silk Road Trader Express is a Telegram mini-app that immerses players in the historical Silk Road trading network while tackling real-world trade finance challenges. As traders navigating ancient cities like Xi’an, Samarkand, Istanbul, and Venice, players face obstacles such as trust issues, delayed payments, access to capital, and inefficient documentation—the same problems modern SMEs encounter in global trade.

Through engaging missions, players discover how the $SRC Ecosystem transforms trade finance using tokenization, blockchain, and digitalization. By overcoming challenges with $SRC’s innovative solutions, they build their trading empires and earn $wSRC tokens as rewards. The game not only entertains but also educates, demonstrating how Web3 technology bridges gaps in global trade financing.
